# Performance bva Feature

## Overview

The Performance bva feature measures Isschat's efficiency against human benchmarks across different task complexity levels. This helps track Isschat's performance improvements and identify areas for optimization.

## Why This Feature?

- **Efficiency Tracking**: Compare Isschat's speed and performance against human benchmarks
- **Complexity Analysis**: Understand how Isschat performs across different task types
- **Quality Metrics**: Measure relevance, hallucination rate, and source coverage
- **Performance Optimization**: Identify bottlenecks and improvement opportunities

## Features

###  **Complexity Levels**

1. **Easy Tasks** (≤2s expected)
   - Title-based searches
   - Metadata queries (author, creation date)
   - Simple fact retrieval

2. **Intermediate Tasks** (≤5s expected)
   - Content analysis
